# 123---RECIPE-APP-final-project
**README FILE**
Lets try to follow some coding conventions to keep our code readable and easy to make changes to because we're collaborating
1. Let's have different UI screens be different files, in each file we can include the backend and the frontend,
    we could also separate the ui files from the backend files.
2. Make sure your variable names are descriptive (don't use 1 letter variables or abbreviations).
3. If the logic in this part is complicated, try to add comments that can make it understandable.
